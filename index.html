                                <p>This project was part of a Codecademy career skill challenge, where I was tasked 
                                    with creating a responsive home page for a club website. I chose to recreate and 
                                    enhance the St. Louis Skating Club home page, focusing on both design and functionality.
                                    This project was by far the most challenging I have undertaken, pushing my skills in 
                                    CSS, particularly in working with flexboxes and keyframe animations. The primary 
                                    objective was to ensure that the site was fully responsive, providing an optimal 
                                    viewing experience across all devices. Through this project, I gained a deeper 
                                    understanding of advanced CSS techniques and learned how to implement complex 
                                    animations to create a visually engaging user experience.</p>

                                <p>This project involved creating a dynamic and visually appealing company home page
                                    for a fictional game design studio, Mystic Echo Interactive. Built entirely 
                                    from scratch, the website showcases a clean and modern design, leveraging the
                                    power of CSS flexboxes to create a responsive and adaptable layout. I crafted
                                    the logo using logo.com, ensuring it aligned with the creative and immersive
                                    spirit of the company. The site is visually enriched with high-quality images
                                    sourced from unsplash.com, which complement the overall design and theme. 
                                    The responsive design ensures that the site provides an optimal viewing 
                                    experience across all devices, reflecting a professional and polished 
                                    company presence. This project was an excellent opportunity to deepen my 
                                    understanding of CSS and responsive web design principles, while also allowing 
                                    me to explore the creative aspects of branding and visual storytelling.</p>

                                <p>This project marks the beginning of my journey into web development, where I was 
                                    tasked with creating a fully functional website design system from scratch. 
                                    The design system was developed to ensure consistency, scalability, and ease 
                                    of use across the website. It includes a cohesive set of UI components, color 
                                    schemes, typography, and layout principles. The website was one of my first 
                                    forays into web development, and through this project, I honed my skills in 
                                    HTML and CSS while learning the importance of a well-structured design system. 
                                    The final product is a reflection of my commitment to quality and attention to 
                                    detail, setting the foundation for my future work in web development.</p>

                        <p>Hi, I'm Alexandra, or Alex for short, a passionate Front-End Developer with a love 
                            for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I specialize 
                            in HTML, CSS, and, Python, JavaScript, with experience in frameworks like 
                            React and a strong focus on responsive and accessible design. I take pride in writing code 
                            that looks great and performs seamlessly across devices. Over the past few 
                            years, I've worked on various projects that have challenged and sharpened 
                            my skills, and I love turning ideas into beautiful and functional digital 
                            experiences. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games like 
                            Dragon Dogma or Ori Will of the Wisps or enjoying a frappe while working on 
                            my next creative project. I'm always open to new opportunities, so feel free 
                            to reach out if you'd like to collaborate!</p>
